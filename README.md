# Titanic-Machine-Learning
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

This project builds a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive the Titanic shipwreck?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

There is three dataset files:-
1) "train.csv"- It contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not.
2) "test.csv"- It also contains the similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger.
3) "submission_final1.csv"- This dataset comprises the prediction whether the other 418 passengers on board(found in test.csv) survived or not.
